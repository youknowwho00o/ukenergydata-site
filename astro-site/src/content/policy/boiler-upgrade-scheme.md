The **Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS)** is a UK government initiative designed to encourage homeowners to replace fossil-fuel heating systems (such as gas and oil boilers) with low-carbon alternatives like air-source or ground-source heat pumps.

### 🏡 What Is the Scheme About?
Launched by **BEIS (Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy)**, the BUS provides financial support to households in England and Wales looking to decarbonize their heating.

- **£7,500 grant** for air-source or ground-source heat pumps  
- The system must replace an existing gas, oil, or direct electric heating system  
- Properties must meet basic insulation standards

### ⚙️ How to Apply
1. Find an **MCS-certified installer** (you can search via Ofgem’s official site).  
2. The installer will apply on your behalf.  
3. Once approved, the grant is paid directly to the installer — reducing your upfront cost.

### 💡 Why It Matters
The average UK household’s heating makes up over **60% of total energy consumption**. Transitioning away from gas heating can reduce both your carbon footprint and exposure to volatile gas prices.

### 📅 Key Dates
- Scheme launched: **May 2022**
- Current phase extended to: **March 2028**
